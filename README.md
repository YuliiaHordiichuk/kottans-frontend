## 0.Git and GitHub
I have never worked with Git before so these courses helped me to dive into a new topic easily. Thanks to [UDACITY](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123) I have learned Git basics and thanks to the game [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=uk) I could clearly understand how different Git commands work. I am about to start working with Git so this new knowledge is very useful.

## 1.Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools
I have not used Linux before so the information was new for me, except for a few commands which I had known before. Besides, I have read articles about HTTP. To be honest, they are quite difficult to understand (for me), so I found some additional articles and video explanations. After that, the information seems more understandable, but still, I will return to the subject again.

## 2.Git Collaboration

A lot of new commands and explanations helped me better understand Git's work and GitHub. I found out how to work on a remote repository with other people and how I can analyze other contributor's commits. I am sure that I will use this knowledge as soon as I start work on remote repositories with other people. Very useful courses!

## 3.Intro to HTML and CSS

I had finished another HTML & CSS course 2 months ago so almost all the information was familiar to me. However, it was a good idea to check my knowledge :) I did not know about CSS property `word-spacing`.

## 4.Responsive Web Design

Useful basic information about adaptive web design and tips on how developers can simplify the process of creating adaptive websites (flexbox, grid, width / max-width). I was surprised by the information about size of the buttons on mobile devices (48*48px) and length of the lines (65 symbols). Responsive web design patterns (column drop, mostly fluid, off-canvas, layout shifter) were a very useful discovery for me. 
The Flexbox game is awesome and I found one more Grid Garden game in extra materials, I liked this one too.

## 5.HTML & CSS practice

Very good practice for a better understanding of website aсcesability. I didn't realize immediately that Tab would easily skip my label to hidden input, but I would say that practice makes perfect :)
